 * @file Adafruit_SPITFT.h
 *
 * Part of Adafruit's GFX graphics library. Originally this class was
 * written to handle a range of color TFT displays connected via SPI,
 * but over time this library and some display-specific subclasses have
 * mutated to include some color OLEDs as well as parallel-interfaced
 * displays. The name's been kept for the sake of older code.
 *
 * Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code,
 * please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by purchasing
 * products from Adafruit!
