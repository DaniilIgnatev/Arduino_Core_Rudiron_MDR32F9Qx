 * mutated to include some color OLEDs as well as parallel-interfaced
 * displays. The name's been kept for the sake of older code.

// To use a font in your Arduino sketch, #include the corresponding .h
// file and pass address of GFXfont struct to setFont().  Pass NULL to
// revert to 'classic' fixed-space bitmap font.
